## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `tp_new.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.2).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your app.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp_new.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the commands:**<br>

- Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add project <PROJECT_NAME>`, `<PROJECT_NAME>` is a parameter which can be used as `add project CS2103`.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (namely `list project`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list project 123`, it will be interpreted as `list project`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

- üö® Some commands that interact with the UI are laggy in V1.3. If you use a command and doesn't notice a change in the UI then try to **click on the project cards and tasks** and it should update to it's current data.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous DevPlan Pro home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **When using v1.3 features**, sometimes the UI doesn't update once the commands are executed. The remedy is to click on the project cards and task cards to update the UI so that it shows the latest data.
